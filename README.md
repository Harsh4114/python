Certainly! Below, I've included example code snippets for each topic covered in the Python Beginner Course:

### 1. Introduction to Python

```python
# Example 1: Hello, World!
print("Hello, World!")

# Example 2: Basic Arithmetic
result = 5 + 3 * 2
print("Result:", result)
```

### 2. Python Basics

```python
# Example 1: Variables and Data Types
name = "John"
age = 25
is_student = False

# Example 2: Input and Output
user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", user_input)
```

### 3. Control Flow

```python
# Example 1: Conditional Statements
num = 10
if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif num == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")

# Example 2: Loops
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Example 3: Exception Handling
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

### 4. Functions

```python
# Example 1: Defining and Calling Functions
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))

# Example 2: Function with Default Parameter
def power(base, exponent=2):
    return base ** exponent

print(power(3))
```

### 5. Data Structures

```python
# Example 1: Lists
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

# Example 2: Tuples
point = (3, 4)

# Example 3: Dictionaries
person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}
```

### 6. File Handling

```python
# Example 1: Writing to a File
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, file!")

# Example 2: Reading from a File
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

### 7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

```python
# Example 1: Class and Object
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
print(my_car.brand)

# Example 2: Inheritance
class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, battery_capacity):
        super().__init__(brand, model)
        self.battery_capacity = battery_capacity
```

### 8. Modules and Packages

```python
# Example 1: Creating a Module (math_operations.py)
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

# Example 2: Using a Module
import math_operations

result = math_operations.add(3, 5)
print(result)
```

### 9. Introduction to Libraries and Frameworks

```python
# Example 1: Using NumPy
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("Sum:", np.sum(arr))

# Example 2: Flask Web Application
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello, Flask!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### 10. Basic Data Analysis and Visualization

```python
# Example 1: Data Analysis with pandas
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['John', 'Alice', 'Bob'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 22]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

# Example 2: Data Visualization with Matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.bar(['John', 'Alice', 'Bob'], [25, 30, 22])
plt.xlabel('Name')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.title('Age Distribution')
plt.show()
```

These examples provide a practical understanding of each topic covered in the Python Beginner Course. Feel free to experiment with these snippets and modify them to deepen your understanding of Python programming concepts.
